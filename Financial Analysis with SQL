GROUP BY year(date_order)
 
3. What is the total sales per product?
SELECT name_product,
sum(total_order_amount) as sales
FROM cursosdata.fac_orders p
LEFT JOIN dim_product pr on pr.SKU_product = p.SKU_product
GROUP BY name_product
ORDER BY sum(total_order_amount) DESC

4. What is the total sales by product but by quantity?

5. At what price has each product been sold? Could you get the unique value?
SELECT 
 DISTINCT name_product,
cost_order
FROM cursosdata.fac_orders p
LEFT JOIN cursosdata.dim_product pr on pr.SKU_product = p.SKU_product

6. what could we attribute this growth in sales? Could we see the sales by product and by year?

LEFT JOIN dim_producto pr on pr.SKU_producto = p.SKU_producto
GROUP BY year(date_order),name_product
ORDER BY name_product,year(date_order) ASC

7. What are the sales by months of the year 2021? Order the sales from highest to lowest.
SELECT month(date_order) as month,

GROUP BY complete_name
ORDER BY sales desc
LIMIT 3

9. What are the top 3 customers who buy by quantity? We need you to bring your full name with last name

CONCAT(nombre_cliente," ",apellido_cliente) as complete_name,
sum(quantity_order) as quantity
FROM cursosdata.fac_orders  pe
LEFT JOIN cursosdata.dim_clientes c on c.id_cliente = pe.id_cliente
GROUP BY complete_name
ORDER BY cantidad desc
LIMIT 3

Compare it with all sales and calculate the percentage in quantitative terms.
with coupons as (
SELECT id_order,
codigo_cupon_order,
CASE WHEN codigo_cupon_order='' then 0 else 1 end as coupons
FROM cursosdata.fac_orders )
SELECT sum(coupons) as total_coupons,
count(DISTINCT p.id_order) as orders,
sum(coupons)/count(DISTINCT p.id_order) as porcentaje
FROM cursosdata.fac_orders  p
LEFT JOIN coupons c on c.id_order=p.id_order

13. Same calculation but broken down by year
with coupons as (
SELECT id_order,
codigo_coupon_order,
CASE WHEN codigo_cupon_order='' then 0 else 1 end as coupons
FROM cursosdata.fac_orders )

SELECT 
year(date_order) as year,
sum(coupons) as total_coupons,
count(DISTINCT p.id_order) as orders,
sum(coupons)/count(DISTINCT p.id_order) as porcentaje
FROM cursosdata.fac_orders  p
LEFT JOIN coupons c on c.id_order=p.id_order
GROUP BY anio

14. What is the total commissions paid to stripe?
SELECT ABS(sum(comision_payment)) as total_comisiones
FROM cursosdata.fac_payments_stripe;

15. What is the commission percentage of each order placed by Stripe?

16. From the previous exercise, what is the mean of the total percentage rounded to two decimal places.
SELECT
ROUND(AVG(comision_payment/importe_payment),3) as porcentaje,
FORMAT(AVG(comision_payment*100/importe_payment),1) as porcentaje_martin

INNER JOIN cursosdata.fac_payments_stripe s on s.id_order=p.id_order

17. Calculate total sales, sales without STRIPE commission and DE STRIPE commissions per year.
SELECT
year(date_order) as year,

IFNULL(sum(comision_payment),0) as comissions,
sum(total_order_amount) + IFNULL(sum(comision_payment),0) as sales_net
FROM cursosdata.fac_orders  p
LEFT JOIN cursosdata.fac_payments_stripe s on s.id_order=p.id_order
GROUP BY year(date_order)

18. How could we know the percentage of sales over the total of each course to see if the Pareto law is fulfilled, which courses should continue and focus and which should be removed?
SELECT DISTINCT name_product,
sum(total_order_amount) OVER (PARTITION BY name_product) as sales,
sum(total_order_amount) OVER (PARTITION BY name_product) / sum(total_order_amount) OVER() * 100 as sales_porcentaje
FROM cursosdata.fac_orders  p
LEFT JOIN dim_producto pr on pr.SKU_producto = p.SKU_producto

UNION ALL

SELECT 'Total',
sum(total_order_amount)  as sales,
100 as sales_porcentaje
FROM cursosdata.fac_orders  p
